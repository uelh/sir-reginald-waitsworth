## Sir Reginald Waitsworth

I made this bot for my friend group because we were all getting annoyed at people saying "brb" and then disappearing forever when we were trying to play games together. It logs when someone takes too long to come back, keeps stats, and has a leaderboard of the worst offenders. It's mostly just for fun and a bit of gentle shaming, but it's actually made people come back faster.
